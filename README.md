Stack and Queue Implementations in Python

Welcome to the Stack and Queue repository! 🚀
This repository contains Python implementations of Stack and Queue data structures along with problem-solving applications.

📌 About the Repository

Implementations of Stack and Queue in Python.

Aim: Solve 40+ problems related to stacks and queues.

Well-structured and optimized code for learning and practice.

🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/stack-queue-repo.git
$ cd stack-queue-repo

2️⃣ Run Implementations

To run any implementation, navigate to the respective folder and execute the Python file:

$ python stack/stack_list.py

📝 Problems to Solve

Here are some of the 40+ stack and queue problems planned for implementation:

Stack Problems

✅ Implement Stack using List
✅ Implement Stack using Linked List
🔲 Next Greater Element
🔲 Valid Parentheses
🔲 Largest Rectangle in Histogram
🔲 ...

Queue Problems

✅ Implement Queue using List
✅ Implement Queue using Linked List
🔲 Implement Circular Queue
🔲 First Unique Character in a Stream
🔲 Sliding Window Maximum
🔲 ...

(More problems will be added as progress is made!)
